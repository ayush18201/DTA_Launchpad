1. How to display images in title bar?
We can display images by using favicon image under a link attribute.
<head>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="path-to-your-favicon"/>
</head>

2. What is the purpose of "alt" attribute of img tag?
The required alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed. The alt attribute provides alternative information 
for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

3. Why do we use tbody, thead, tfoot tags?
The <tbody> tag is used in conjunction with the <thead> tag and the <tfoot> tag in determining each part of the table (header, footer, body). 
Browsers can use this information to enable scrolling of the table body independently of the header and footer - particularly useful for large tables.
